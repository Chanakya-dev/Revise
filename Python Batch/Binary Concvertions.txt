Binary conversion is the process of converting a number from its decimal (base 10) representation to binary (base 2) representation, and vice versa. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of both conversions:

1. Decimal to Binary Conversion
The binary system uses only two digits, 0 and 1. To convert a decimal number to binary, you can use the method of repeated division by 2. Here's how it works:

Steps:
Divide the decimal number by 2.
Record the remainder. This will be the least significant bit (LSB).
Update the decimal number to the quotient obtained from the division.
Repeat the process until the quotient is 0.
Read the remainders in reverse order to get the binary representation.



2. Binary to Decimal Conversion
To convert a binary number back to decimal, you can use the method of weighted sums. Each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the right (which is the least significant bit).

Steps:
Write down the binary number.
Assign powers of 2 to each digit, starting from 0 on the right.
Multiply each digit by its corresponding power of 2.
Sum all the results.
Example:
Convert the binary number 1101 to decimal.

Write down the powers of 2:

So, 1101 in binary is 13 in decimal.
